# üèõÔ∏è Legal Assistance Bot with Candidate Elimination Algorithm

A sophisticated legal assistance system that uses the **Candidate Elimination Algorithm** from Machine Learning to provide intelligent legal advice and case classification. The system learns from historical legal case data to predict whether legal action is needed and provides personalized guidance.

- **Public Interest Litigation (PIL)**: RTI delays, public welfare issues

## üß† Candidate Elimination Algorithm

### What is Candidate Elimination?
The Candidate Elimination algorithm is a concept learning algorithm that:
- Maintains two boundaries: **Specific** and **General** hypotheses
- Learns from both positive and negative examples
- Converges to the target concept through iterative refinement
- Provides transparent, interpretable decision-making

### How it Works in Legal Context
1. **Training Phase**: 
   - Processes historical legal cases with known outcomes
   - Builds specific hypothesis (most restrictive pattern for legal action)
   - Maintains general hypotheses (broader patterns that exclude non-legal cases)

2. **Prediction Phase**:
   - Compares new cases against learned hypotheses
   - Provides confidence levels based on hypothesis coverage
   - Generates contextual legal guidance

### Algorithm Advantages
- **Interpretable**: You can see exactly what patterns the model learned
- **Incremental Learning**: Can update with new cases without retraining from scratch
- **Handles Uncertainty**: Provides confidence levels for predictions
- **No Overfitting**: Naturally generalizes well due to hypothesis boundaries
