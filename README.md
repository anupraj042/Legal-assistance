# üèõÔ∏è Legal Assistance Bot with Candidate Elimination Algorithm

A sophisticated legal assistance system that uses the **Candidate Elimination Algorithm** from Machine Learning to provide intelligent legal advice and case classification. The system learns from historical legal case data to predict whether legal action is needed and provides personalized guidance.

## üéØ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Intelligent Case Classification**: Uses Candidate Elimination algorithm to learn legal patterns
- **Personalized Legal Guidance**: Provides specific advice based on case type and circumstances
- **Web-based Interface**: User-friendly Flask web application
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant legal advice based on case parameters
- **Model Transparency**: View trained model hypotheses and decision patterns

### Legal Case Types Supported
- **Civil Cases**: Property disputes, eviction, cheque bounce
- **Criminal Cases**: Theft, domestic violence, dowry harassment
- **Consumer Cases**: Non-delivery, false advertising, defective products
- **Family Cases**: Divorce, child custody, maintenance
- **Environmental Cases**: Pollution, illegal mining, land violations
- **Public Interest Litigation (PIL)**: RTI delays, public welfare issues

## üß† Candidate Elimination Algorithm

### What is Candidate Elimination?
The Candidate Elimination algorithm is a concept learning algorithm that:
- Maintains two boundaries: **Specific** and **General** hypotheses
- Learns from both positive and negative examples
- Converges to the target concept through iterative refinement
- Provides transparent, interpretable decision-making

### How it Works in Legal Context
1. **Training Phase**: 
   - Processes historical legal cases with known outcomes
   - Builds specific hypothesis (most restrictive pattern for legal action)
   - Maintains general hypotheses (broader patterns that exclude non-legal cases)

2. **Prediction Phase**:
   - Compares new cases against learned hypotheses
   - Provides confidence levels based on hypothesis coverage
   - Generates contextual legal guidance

### Algorithm Advantages
- **Interpretable**: You can see exactly what patterns the model learned
- **Incremental Learning**: Can update with new cases without retraining from scratch
- **Handles Uncertainty**: Provides confidence levels for predictions
- **No Overfitting**: Naturally generalizes well due to hypothesis boundaries

    "Property Dispute",   # Sub-Type  
    ">1L",               # Value > 1 Lakh
    "Yes",               # Agreement Signed
    "Yes",               # Notice Given
    "No",                # Not Consumer Complaint
    "No"                 # Not Matrimonial Issue
]

result, guidance = predict(case)
# Output: "Yes", "Legal action recommended (High confidence). 
#         Consider consulting a civil lawyer and filing a suit in district court."
